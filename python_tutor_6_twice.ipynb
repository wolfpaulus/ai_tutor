        "1. Explain what a computer does, define what computer science is, and describe the historical development of both.\n",
        "2. Define computer programming, and explain the difference between programming methods, programming languages and programming tools.\n",
        "3. Describe the parts of an algorithm and recognize certain widely used algorithms and problem solving patterns.\n",
        "4. Hand-trace the execution of an algorithm. (â€¦debugging)\n",
        "5. <font color=007fff>**Code an algorithm as a sequence of high level statements.  (â€¦ programming)**</font>\n",
        "6. Explain how to detect and correct syntax and logic errors when compiling a program and explain the importance of good coding style in programming.\n",
        "7. Explain how abstractions such as new data types, subprograms, and defined constants can simplify a program."
