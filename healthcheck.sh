# This script is used to check the health of the application
# By default, CMD ["python3.11", "src/ws.py"] will launch the ws.py application.
# However, this can be changed by providing a different command when running the container.
# I.e. docker run <container-id> /ai_tutor/healthcheck.sh
# This script will launch the ws.py application, wait for 2 seconds and then check the health of the application.
# It will then kill the application and exit with 0 if the health check was OK, otherwise it will exit with 1.
